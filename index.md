Welcome to the prework. Here, you will find everything you need to get set up and ready to go before entering class.

# Prework Schedule

Prework is divided into three phases. The first two phases are required. The third phase is optional, but is strongly recommended. If the third phase is not completed before the bootcamp begins it will be assigned as homework so it will completed at some point during the bootcamp.
