Welcome to the prework. Here, you will find everything you need to get set up and ready to go before entering class.

# DataCamp Access

We have partnered with DataCamp to provide you with a free account while you're in the bootcamp. Some of our prework is done through DataCamp. You will have access to all DataCamp offerings, so feel free to supplement your learning with other DataCamp offerings (if you have the time).

# Prework Schedule

Prework is divided into three phases. The first two phases are required. The third phase is optional, but is strongly recommended. If the third phase is not completed before the bootcamp begins it will be assigned as homework so it will completed at some point during the bootcamp.

**Note that instructions and links are at the last section of this webpage**

# Phase 1: Toolchain Setup

This phase should be completed by Monday, February 17, 2020.

# Phase 2: Python Basics

This phase should be completed by Monday, February 24, 2020. 

- Complete the DataCamp course "Introduction to Python". 

Access to DataCamp will be supplied when you email you instructor your CNM email address.

# Phase 3: R and SQL Basics 

This phase is optional as prework, but if possible it should be completed by Monday, February 24, 2020. If it is not completed it will be considered extra homework after the bootcamp starts. These items WILL need to be completed eventually.

- Complete the DataCamp course "Introduction to R". 
- Complete the DataCamp course "Introduction to SQL". 

Again, access to DataCamp will be supplied when you email you instructor your CNM email address.

# Links and Instructions

_**Create your CNM Student Account**_

In order to attend the bootcamp, you are required to apply for admission to CNM as a visiting student. This is true even if you’re already a CNM student, with a student account. To register, follow the instructions as [Visitor Students](https://www.cnm.edu/depts/enrollment/admissions/visitor-students).
**Please watch your email for acceptance of your registration!** This acceptance message will include your CNM student ID number, and your CNM e-mail address. **Without access to your cnm.edu e-mail account several critical steps of the pre-work will be impossible to complete.**

_**Activate your CNM Student Account**_

Once you have received your CNM email address and student ID number, you should activate your email account through the [https://my.cnm.edu](https://my.cnm.edu) portal. You must use this email address, and have access to your CNM email account, for some later steps in the pre-work.

To activate your CNM email,

1. Browse to [https://my.cnm.edu](https://my.cnm.edu).
1. You will then be prompted to provide a name and password. Please note the paragraph stating
> If this is your first time using my CNM, your password is your 6-digit date of birth followed by ‘atCNM’ (MMDDYYatCNM).
**Even if you had another CNM email address before**, if this is your first time logging in with your new address, you will need to use the initial default password.
1. After using the initial default password, you will need to create a new password. **Please keep track of this password. In some cases, your instructors can help you reset your CNM account password, but there is no way for the instructors to recover a lost password.**
1. Once you are logged in, click the **My Mail** link at the top of the page, to access your CNM email account.
1. Answer any setup questions as appropriate.

**Do not lose these credentials!** They are essential not only in several steps of the pre-work, but also in obtaining and maintaining access to the network and server resources that you will use virtually every day of the bootcamp. A lost password can be reset, but requesting that reset (and re-establishing access in a timely fashion) will be **your** responsibility, not your instructors’.
    
_**Sign Up For Your DataCamp Free Account**_

[This is the DataCamp link](https://www.datacamp.com/users/sign_up). **Be sure to use your CNM.edu email!** Also, just sign up for the free account, we will give you access to the classes when you notify us that your account is active.

_**Sign up for Github (if you don't already have an account)**_

In this course, _all_ of your code will be maintained in Git repositories, with remote copies hosted on GitHub. Therefore, it’s essential that you have a GitHub account. This may be a free account; none of the work in the bootcamp will require you to have a paid account.

If you don’t already have a GitHub account, register for one by following the directions at [Signing up for a new GitHub account](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account). **Please note:** As a data scientist, your GitHub account will become a significant part of your online professional identity; choose your user name accordingly.

_**Sign up for Gmail (if you don't already have an account)**_

[This is the link to sign up for Gmail.](https://www.google.com/gmail/about/) You'll need a Gmail account to be ablew to use Google Colab which we will use to perform data science in the cloud. Again, just get the basic package which is free.
