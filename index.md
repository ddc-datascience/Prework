Welcome to the prework. Here, you will find everything you need to get set up and ready to go before entering class.

# DataCamp Access

We have partnered with DataCamp to provide you with a free account while you're in the bootcamp. Some of our prework is done through DataCamp. You will have access to all DataCamp offerings, so feel free to supplement your learning with other DataCamp offerings (if you have the time).

# Prework Schedule

Prework is divided into three phases. The first two phases are required. The third phase is optional, but is strongly recommended. If the third phase is not completed before the bootcamp begins it will be assigned as homework so it will completed at some point during the bootcamp.

# Phase 1: Toolchain Setup

This phase should be completed by Monday, February 17, 2020.
